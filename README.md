# Password-Generator
In this project we are working with Javascript.
We are building on an existing code for the password generator.
The requirement for password is that the user should have the password length of minimum 8 characters and more more that 128 charaters.
After the user will choose the legth of the password, they will get a windows confim box requesting if they would like to have numericCharacters, 
specialCharacters, upperCaseCharacters and lowerCaseCharacters.
I have created a function to generate the password.
I have used if and else conditions, for loop, math random to generate the password
